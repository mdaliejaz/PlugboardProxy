CSE508: Network Security, Spring 2016

Homework 3: Plugboard Proxy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A "plugboard" proxy for adding an extra layer of protection to publicly 
accessible network services has been developed.

The C program uses the OpenSSL library for all cryptographic operations, 
and run on Linux. The program conforms to the specification mentioned in
problem statement.

Data is encrypted/decrypted using AES in CTR mode.

The implementation works for multiple ssh logins and has been tested on ubuntu.
The program should work on any linux distros.

Files:
-------
pbproxy.c - The main driver program
server.c - The part of the code handling connection on the server's end
client.c - The part of the code handling connection on the client's end
header.h - Common header file
Utils.h - Common utilities for server.c and client.c
Makefile - To generate the distributable
keyfile - A sample key

Execution Steps:
-----------------
1. make
2. For server:
	./pbproxy -l <server_port> -k <keyfile> localhost <ssh_port>
3. For client:
	ssh -o "ProxyCommand ./pbproxy -k <keyfile> <server_name> <server_port>" localhost
